## Hi there 👋

🌱 I’m currently learning  
Python programming, Linux system administration, networking fundamentals, and embedded development with ESP32.

🔐 Currently working with  
Introductory cybersecurity tools and lab-based security practices.

💬 Ask me about  
Fedora Linux, virtual machines, basic networking, ESP32 projects, and setting up simple security labs.

⚡ Fun fact  
I enjoy experimenting in virtual labs and testing ideas on both software and hardware.
